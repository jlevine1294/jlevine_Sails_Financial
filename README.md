Frameworks are nice because they automate some of the overhead, so that developers do not have to worry about making functions libraries or databases that are used commonly. A negative aspect is that with a site built by scratch you can do whatevery you want and with a frame work you have to follow the rules set forth by the framework. Applications that would benifit from frameworks are ones that need to be standardized whether to make it work with other applications or to follow laws and requlations. 
An application that does not need a frame work, would be one that is very simple and does not need the  overhead to be made for it. three things i learned from this assignment are, how to use heroku and what it is, how to connect my local development to an online hosting site, and how to use an api. The videos could be improved a bit, the text in them, even when im in full screen moode on my laptop was hard to read.
